							<p class="align-left">Gros Morne is a National Park on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987. Gros Morne is also the name of the highest mountain in the park. Its summit, at 806 m of elevation, is a pinnacle point. Gros Morne is a very old and flat-topped mountain with amazing views of the surrounding glacier-carved valleys and inland freshwater fjords. The mountains here host Arctic tundra far south of its usual range.

							<p>All routes can be described as getting to the Gros Morne Summit Trail, and following the trail to the summit. The Gros Morne Summit Trail is a loop. Ascending clockwise requires climbing up scree, whereas the counterclockwise ascent is mostly wooden steps. Although you can take either route up, park staff highly discourage people from descending down the scree path to prevent loose rocks from injuring hikers below you. It is not recommended to ascend the mountain while there is fog on top, which is a common occurance in Newfoundland.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Gros Morne Trail – Single Day</h3>

							<p>The day hike is the most popular way to get to the top of Gros Morne. It covers 17.2 km of distance and 800 m of elevation gain. Just because it is a day hike, that doesn’t mean anyone can do it. It is a strenuous trail. If choosing the day hike, be sure to bring enough water to make it back to the parking lot. There are a couple primitive toilets along the way. Be sure to avoid the turn down the Long Range Traverse to the east of the mountain, this trail will not take you back to the parking lot.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Gros Morne Trail - Multiple Days</h3>

							<p>There is a primitive campsite, Ferry Gulch, on the east side of Gros Morne mountain. There are tent platforms, picnic tables, a primitive toilet, a bear vault, a clear pond to get water from, and great mountain valley view. This campsite makes it possible to divide the standard day hike over 2-3 days. You can leave most of your camping gear at the campsite while you climb to the summit, only taking essentials with you. I recommend this option if you are worried about being able to hike the entire Gros Morne Trail in a single day, or if you are looking for a tame backpacking experience.</p>

							</span>

							<h3 class="softblack">Long Range Traverse</h3>

							<p>The Long Range Traverse is a rugged unmarked backcountry route typically done over 3-5 days. If using this trail to go up Gros Morne, the route is about 40 km with almost 1,500 m of elevation gain. This trail can commonly be seen in “Top Backpacking Trails in the World” lists for its stunning sweeping vistas. The lack of tall trees allows you to see the glacier-carved barrens all the way to the horizon. There are designated campsites approximately every 6 km with a toilet and bear vault, however, you are allowed to hike and camp just about anywhere. Bring a bear cannister if planning on camping away from designated campsites.</p>

								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>There is a mandatory safety orientation meeting the day before you start hiking where an emergency beacon can be borrowed for free. The Long Range Traverse is a point-to-point trail, so your best options is to park at the end of the trail and taxi to the start. To save on cost, I recommend trying to meet other backpackers at the orientation meeting to share the taxi with. Be sure to reserve the taxi the day before you need it. Some taxis are cash only. The road to the trailhead gives stark anticipatory views of the mountains to come on one side, while ocean waves crash into the rocky coastline on the other.</p>

									</i></br></br></figcaption>
								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>The hiking starts on the Western Brook Pond Trail, a flat 3 km trail that terminates at the west end of Western Brook Pond of all places. There is a reasonably priced café at the end of the trail that serves burgers and hotdogs. This “pond” is more accurately described as a lake. It was a once a fjord filled with seawater, but it has since been landlocked and replaced with freshwater naturally. The Long Range Traverse starts on the other side of this serpentine lake, and an hour long boat tour must be taken to get there. BonTours is the only company that offers this service. Impressively enclosing cliffs stand tall down the entire length of the lake. The boat tour is a very popular day-trip activity for tourists. Few will be getting off the boat with you.</p>

									</i></br></br></figcaption>
								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>When the boat drops you off, you need to hike up the valley and over the cliffs you’ve been gawking at. From here, the trail has a long stretch through the Long Range Barrens until it eventually meets with the Gros Morne Summit Trail.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Northern Traverse and Long Range Traverse</h3>

							<p>The Northern Traverse can be used to extend the Long Range Traverse hike by approximately double. It is a route that connects the Western Brook Pond Trail to the Long Range Traverse by going around Western Brook Pond. This extension unfortunately makes the boat tour unnecessary. The Northern Traverse is beautiful, but some sections can be even more strenuous than the Long Range Traverse. Many get lost in the large swaths of tuckamore, dense short coniferous forest.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Day 1</h3>

							<p class="align-left">I met two fellow backpackers at my hostel that were entering the Long Range Traverse the same day as me. We decided to taxi to the Western Brook Pond Trail together. We arrived at the Café at the end of the trail well over an hour before boarding. I used this time to ingest as many calories as I could, and I suggest you do the same. I ordered a cheeseburger, hot dog, two cans of pop, and a pack of brownies to-go. As we ate, one of my taxi companions realized he lost his phone! In a panic, he checked everywhere it could be. With nothing found, he ran to the trailhead 3 km back, hoping it was dropped on the way.</p>

							<p class="align-left">As for me, the quick influx of food was naturally followed by comatose. The day-trippers gave curious looks as an increasingly-homeless-looking man rolled out a mat for a nap. When I woke up, the man without a phone had returned emptied handed, evident by his obvious fervor as he searched through his backpack again. As there always is, there was one pocket he forgot to check, a belt pocket. When he at last opened that pocket and pulled out his phone, the watching crowed laughed and cheered.</p>

							<p class="align-left">It wasn’t long before boarding started. Since the upper floor of the boat was full, I stayed on the lower level, as close to the front as I could. The boat tour really was as good as they say. It would be well worthwhile on its own. I couldn’t have been more fortunate with the weather on this day. Sunny, windy, and warm, but not hot. One side of the fjord was in direct sunlight, while the other was in shade. The steep cliffs and deep water allowed the boat to get impossibly close to the waterfalls. The boat spun in key spots to make sure everyone got the best view.</p>

								</figure>
							</span>

							<p class="align-left">At the drop-off dock, the day-trippers gave us applause as we took our first steps on the Long Range Traverse. A welcome encouragement for such a foreboding trail. After a quick farewell at the dock, I was the first to start the ascent up the valley. I was eager to make as much distance as I could today, while the weather was good. The climb up the valley was awesome technical hiking. The ground turned from dirt to gravel to stones to boulders. As I hiked up, I was rewarded with increasingly stunning views of Western Brook Pond behind me. The final climb was up bare smooth rock that was slippery where it was wet. The wind as you approach the top was enough to make you lose your footing if you weren’t careful. The top of the valley gives the most breathtaking view of the winding corridor. Don’t rush these views.</p>

									</i></br></br></figcaption>
								</figure>
							</span>

							<p class="align-left">As soon as I crested the top, the wind died down and the mud began. The trail through Long Range Barrens was mud, and where it wasn’t mud the ground was still soaking wet like a sponge. Don’t be fooled by the warm hues the barrens take on in autumn, it will all be wet. If you get lucky and it hasn’t rained for a while, it will still be muddy everywhere. Water does not flow downhill in Gros Morne, even the slopes were perpetually wet. Your feet will not stay dry. Nearly the entire 22 km stretch from the Western Brook Pond Lookout to Ferry Gulch was slop. Beautiful slop, but slop.</p>

								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>I arrived at the Marks Pond campsite an hour before sunset. I set up my tent by the water, and dried off my feet while I prepared dinner. I prefer to sleep in a hammock while in the backcountry, but the stunted trees couldn't be relied on to keep me off the ground. Although, the trees and boulders would have been sufficient to rely on a gravity filter. There were frequent clear sources of water along the trail, so not much water had to be carried while hiking. I hoped another group would make it this far before it got dark, but nobody came. No campfires are allowed in the park, so it was an early night.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Day 2</h3>

							<p>I knew rain was in the forecast for later this day, so I wanted to get on the trail as early as I could. With some good furtune, maybe I could make it to Ferry Gulch. I started preparing breakfast as soon as I had daylight. As I was eating in dawn, I saw two objects pop above the crest of a nearby hill. They were the antlers of a buck moose! I finished eating breakfast as I watched the graceful giant stroll out of view.</p>

									</i></br></br></figcaption>
								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>When I got on the trail, I realized an odd plant I kept seeing was a northern pitcher plant. They were growing all over the barrens. At a later point, a flock of Willow Ptarmigans and I spooked each other as they were feeding just off the trail. Their camouflage is both effective and beautiful. The area being so open gives good oppritunity for viewing wildlife, but there is not much protection from the wind. Be prepared.</p>

							<p>In general, it is easy to follow the path most people take by eye. However, you can accidently go down game trails so it’s good to check your GPS frequently. I recommend investing in a proper GPS app on your phone or a dedicated device. While going around Lower Green Island Pond the wrong way, I slipped in mud and hurt my right ankle a little bit. Instead of pushing to Ferry Gulch, I decided to camp at the nearby tent pads, and spend the rest of the day massaging my ankle. At this point I wasn’t sure if this would be a 3 or 4 day hike. It would depend on how my ankle felt in the morning.</p>

							<p>As I ate dinner, an older group of three came and set up camp at the two tent pads next to me. They entered the day before me, but I passed them when they took the long way around a climb. It was nice to have some company. They were the only people I saw anywhere from the boat drop-off to Ferry Gulch. It didn’t start raining until late in the afternoon, but when it did it poured. Everything stayed dry in the tent.</p>

							<h3 class="softblack">Day 3</h3>

							<p>I woke up to thick fog and an ankle that wasn’t much better. The fog was so thick I could barely see 10 m beyond me. At this point, my goal today was just to make it to Ferry Gulch. There, I could let me ankle rest more. I could hike up the mountain then to the parking lot tomorrow. I hiked every step with incredible attention, to not worsen my injury. My GPS was checked frequently to make sure I didn't take a wrong turn in the fog. Even though I couldn’t see much from the lookouts, they fog itself gave the landscape an appealing eerie atmosphere.</p>

									<figcaption class="max-width-600 center-image"><i>Blouders peering through the fog.
									</i></br></br></figcaption>
								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>Before I knew it, I made it to Ferry Gulch, and my ankle wasn’t any worse for it. From this point, there would be no more mud. The fog was clear here at the bottom of Gros Morne, but the top was still entirely capped in fog. Thankfully, over the hour lunch I had at Ferry Gulch, the fog slowly lifted. Instead of setting up camp, I decided to hike up to the pinnacle point, leaving most of my gear hidden behind the camp toilet. I was going up and down the same way, using the easier trail near Ferry Gulch with wooden steps. I ran into many day hikers as I was going up. Many looked like they underestimated the trail.</p>

								</figure>

							<p>It was a little emotional approaching the summit. This would be my second visited pinnacle point, after Algonquin Park's high point, but this was more what I envisioned a pinnacle point to be like. The views as you approach the flat top are unobstructed and simply amazing. The sun was starting to come out. The slog through the mud really made this pinnacle point feel earned. I took my time around the summit, taking it all in. Near the pinnacle point, I stumbled upon another flock willow ptarmigans, undaunted this time.</p>

								</figure>
							</span>

							<p>The rest of the trail was downhill from where I stood, and my ankle was still feeling the same as when I woke up. I was determined to get out today. I made it back down the mountain to my backpack in no time. It started raining as I hiked towards the parking lot from Ferry Gulch. I underestimated how long it would take to hike this section, so I didn’t bother with rain gear. Exhausted and wet, I made it to the parking lot in three days after all. As soon as I did, I drove to a recommended restaurant in Rocky Harbour and had myself a much needed Moose Burger with cloudberry pie and ice cream. I would recommend moose, but not as the first meal off the trail. It was too lean and I was craving a fatty burger. As for the pie, the locally foraged berries were well worth the price, once.</p>

							<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <button class="small" onclick="window.scrollTo({top: 0, behavior: 'smooth'})">Top</button></h2> 

							<p>The scenery on the Long Range Travers is among the most impressive I've ever seen. The short vegetation gives neverending panoramic views. My favourite sections of the trail were the two major acents: up the Western Brook Pond valley and up Gros Morne mountain. These sections each give increasing impressive views all the way to the top, and you can keep your feet dry. Unfortunately, the long strech of mud between these two sections left me shocked that this trail is so highly revered. From what I hear, the weather I had on the trail was better than usual. I can't imagine hiking through that mud on a particularly rainy day. Every point of the trail is beautiful, but the best sections can be day hiked. Unless you are the kind of backpacker that enjoys the suffering, I recommend day hiking Gros Morne mountain. Consider hiking the Western Brook Pond valley as a day hike as well. The boat tour, at least, is a must.</p>
