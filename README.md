# PinnaclePoints
A **pinnacle point** is defined as a point with a zero **inferiority**. The inferiority of a point is defined as the point's elevation minus the maximum elevation that can be seen in a direct line of sight from the point. Since all points can see themselves, the minimum possible inferiority is zero.
