# PinnaclePoints
A **pinnacle point** is a point from which no higher point can be seen. More specifically, a pinnacle point is a point with zero **inferiority**, where inferiority is defined as the maximum elevation that can be seen in a direct line of sight from a point minus the point's elevation. Since all points can see themselves, the minimum possible inferiority is zero.
