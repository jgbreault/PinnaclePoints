    "In polar coordinates, the observer of a line of sight is at $P_1 = (R_\\oplus + h_1, 0)$ and the target is at $P_2 = (R_\\oplus + h_2, D_s/R_\\oplus)$. Light follows the arc of a circle with radius $R_L = CR_\\oplus$. Find the contrast of the target from the perspective of the observer in terms of $h_1$, $h_2$, $D_s$, $H$, $S$, $a$, $\\beta_0$, $C$, and $R_\\oplus$.\n",
